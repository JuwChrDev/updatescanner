# Update Scanner

Chrome port of sneakypete81's Firefox addon to monitors web pages for updates.

Just a few changes to fix the incompatibility between Chrome and Firefox, like Chrome not supporting an extension sidebar .
All credit to Mike, the complete functionality is his doing, I only needed it on Chrome.

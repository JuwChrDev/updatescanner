# Update Scanner for Chrome

Chrome port of sneakypete81's Firefox addon to monitor web pages for updates.

Just a few changes to fix the incompatibility between Chrome and Firefox, like Chrome not supporting an extension sidebar .
All credit to sneakypete81, the complete functionality is his doing, I only needed it on Chrome, hence the quick and dirty porting.
